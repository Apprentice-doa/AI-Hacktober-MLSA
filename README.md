# Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge organized by the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Community! We're thrilled to have you on board for this exciting journey of collaboration and open-source contributions.

## About the Challenge

This challenge focuses on two main tracks:

1. **Pure Machine Learning (ML) Projects**: Dive into the world of ML without relying on any cloud services. We aim to build innovative ML solutions from the ground up.

2. **Microsoft-Powered Projects**: Leverage the power of Microsoft products and tools to create impactful open-source solutions.

## How to Participate

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Choose a Project**: Browse our projects and choose one that interests you. You can contribute to both tracks if you'd like!

3. **Make Contributions**: Make meaningful contributions by fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or addressing issues. Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/AI-Hacktober-MLSA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit your contributions as pull requests. Please follow our contribution guidelines outlined in the project's README.
